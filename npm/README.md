# goodcommit (npm)

Install the `goodcommit` binary from GitHub Releases via npm.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g goodcommit
```

Commands installed:
- `goodcommit`
- `g`

For `g.` (dot) alias, use the curl installer or Homebrew.

## Setup

```bash
goodcommit setup
```

Setup asks for your provider, push defaults, and (if OpenAI) your API key.
You can also set `OPENAI_API_KEY` instead of storing it in config.
